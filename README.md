These are some key points that I have implemented in this project:
• The technology used in this project is HTML, Tailwind CSS, and React.js. 
• For Connecting to different pages React-Router DOM is being used. 
• For accessing the API and fetching into the DOM a react library called Axios is used. 
• React Infinite Scroll is used where new content is automatically loaded and appended to a 
web page as the user scrolls down.
